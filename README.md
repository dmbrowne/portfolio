# Portfolio

Website to showcase projects that I have built over the years. I used a theme as design isn't my strong point, the theme used can be found here:
https://themeforest.net/item/oblas-react-app-portfolio/24519128.

It is built using `create-react-app` _3_.

The site is currently using hard coded _json_ files in order to achieve a quick turnaround. But this will be hooked up to firestore in the future and likely a cms.

### To do:

This repo is a work in progress the following are things that are planned.

- Convert structure to flat instead or hierarchical - for project as simple as a portfolio, there is no need for nested folders as there aren't that many pages/features.
- Convert to typescript
- Add tests
- Replace hardcoded json with cloud firestore
- Create a cms or admin interface to make adding/editing projects more efficient
- Code entropy
